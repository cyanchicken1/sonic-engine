Introduction
============
This project will aim to recreate the original Sonic the Hedgehog game engine in Java. It will use hardware-accelerated
graphics and the final aim is to have an extensible engine where people can write their own characters and perhaps
implement a full level editor. It should also match the original engine pixel for pixel for true authentic gameplay.

Status
======
PRE-ALPHA:
No official releases have yet been made; the engine is still in pre-alpha state. This means that the graphics are an
un-skinned representation of the engine and not all engine features will be complete. It will move into alpha state
when basic physics are implemented correctly.

Releases
========
V0.01 (Pre-Alpha) - A moving black box. This version will be complete when we have an unskinned box that can traverse
terrain in the same way Sonic would in the original game.

Changelog
=========
Changelog will be added when we move out of Pre-Alpha status.
